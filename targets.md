# Dtk Assemblies

As Components are the building blocks, as a Dtk developer you then "assemble" them together into topology templates for complex deployments that are highly reusable and easy to share with other developers.


## Targets

A Target acts as a deployment context and predictable state container for your applications and Services that are deployed and managed via the Dtk.  Keeping to our simple DSL mantra a Target is simply a "type" of Assembly made up of Dtk Components that represent resources such as networking and connectivity constructs (ie: subnets, firewalls, etc).
