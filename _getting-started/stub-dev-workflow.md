# Tossed this here for now, dont realy think we should go into developer workflow details in the getting started section

# Base user workflows

There are two main Dtk workflows, each having their own variations:
* A workflow for a Dtk user that is developing deployment templates
* A workflow for a Dtk user that is using already built templates to deploy his or her application or service stack
These two workflows can also be intermixed, for example in developing the deployment templates, the user would want to test the logic by spinning up the templates under construction. In section (???ref) we show how the Dtk provides sandboxes to test these changes

Diagram (?diagram ref) depicts the workflow for a user that is creating deployment templates and introduces some base termniology.
