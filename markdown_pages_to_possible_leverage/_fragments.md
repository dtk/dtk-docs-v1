A Dtk user can invoke an action on a single component or invoke an assembly workflow that coordinates a set of actions, which can span multiple layers in a complex stack.  When an action is executed, the Dtk dispatches the action to either a selected node where the implementation code is run or runs the action's implementation code in a Dtk internal container. This latter case is used, for example, when the implementation code is calling rest services interacting with resources deployed on an Internet or networked service.
